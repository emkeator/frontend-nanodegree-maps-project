## How to Run the Utah National Park Nexis

This is intended to be a helpful tool for someone in Utah trying to figure out what National Parks are a relatively close option, and to allow them to filter by time and origin location. But, you do not have to be in Utah to use it! 

1. **Exploring the parks:**

   Explore the list of parks above the map; clicking on an item in the list will bring up the infowindow on the map with the park's name and a brief blurb regarding its attractions and features. You can also just browse the map--clicking on the markers will also open the infowindow.

2. **Filtering by time:**

   Choose a maximum time duration that you are willing to travel (1-7, or 10, hours) from the dropdown menu and type in your origin. You can give a full address (i.e. "123 Main Street, Salt Lake City, UT") or simply a city (i.e. "Los Angeles", "Moab", "Jackson Hole"). Click "Go" and the map will show only the destinations within the given time frame from the marked origin point; a list will appear above the map of each park and its distance in time and miles. If none are found, you will recieve a notification and only your given origin will be displayed.
   
3. **Further searches:**

   If you wish to change the origin or the time frame, simply type in your new origin and/or change your time frame, and again click "GO". The map and list will update accordingly.
   
4. **Resetting the map and page:**

   Click "Clear" and the map will reset itself to show all the parks as originally displayed, and the full list of parks will return.
